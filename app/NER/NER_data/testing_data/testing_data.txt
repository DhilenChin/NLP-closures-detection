@mystic_shrimp @mystic_shrimp Direct quote from Traffic Officer at scene overnight, "It stinks". They get all the best jobs!
Our only option now is to resurface the area which we are organising as soon as possible. If heading to #Cumbria #LakeDistrict today, please plan ahead as lane closures are likely to be in place for most of today. PS - If you know which vehicle lost the load, pls let us know! 2/2
The #A1M southbound has lane 2 closed at J37 #Marr #Doncaster due to a collision. Recovery is on their way but the vehicles cannot be moved in the meantime. Delays building on the approach. https://t.co/fbocjLoNYW

@DurhamPolice UPDATE - The closures at J60 and J62 have now been removed. We now have up and over closure in place at J61 in both directions. Traffic leaving the #A1M via the exit slip and rejoin via the entry slip.
@DurhamPolice Were making preparations to remove the closures at J60 and J62. Traffic will be able to divert around this incident by leaving at #A1M at J61 and rejoining from the roundabout in both directions soon. Well then start the barrier repairs.
2/2 There will be closures within junctions (traffic diverted off at the exit and back on at the entry slip) in some areas so we can still complete some work. The closures have been adjusted to avoid drivers being diverted twice along the same route in a similar area.
1/2 In light of the ongoing closure of the #A1M in #Durham, the below closures are CANCELLED for tonight: #A19 Norton to Wynyard #A1 north J77 to J79 #A1 south J77 to J74
@JulesMountain @DurhamPolice @JulesMountain Hi Julie, it's looking unlikely at this time but we can't definitively give an opening time. Probably best to plan an alternative route or allow more time to take into account the diversion.
We're still working closely with @DurhamPolice as they continue their painstaking investigation into the collsion on the #A1M at J61. It is likely that the current closures will remain in place for the remainder of today. https://t.co/UzEfI0VRd9 https://t.co/6Srw8CAsEN
