@Simdru @DurhamPolice Hi Simon, thanks for the tweet. We have no estimated time for re-opening at the moment but it is likely to be closed into the evening if this assists with planning your journey?
@CazB82 @DurhamPolice @CazB82 @DurhamPolice Hi, The road remains closed at this time. We will advise on the feed once the road reopens. We do not have a time for the road to be open again at this time.
@arianasbeyond @arianasbeyond Hi, the entry slip northbound at J61 is open
Traffic heading southbound does not have a signed diversion route as the closure is between J62 &amp; J60.  Emergency routes are normally one junction to the next. Heat maps shows congestion around #Durham as traffic leaves the A1M and uses #A690 #A167 #A689 Please plan your journey
Traffic heading northbound should follow the diversion route by leaving the A1M at J60 and follow the route with the solid black square. This route is suitable for all vehicles. There are some delays on this route at #Thinford #A167 #A688 junction. https://t.co/XOCUV0vUsk
A1M remains closed in both directions:- north is closed J60 to J61 - south is closed J62 to J60 The road will remain closed throughout the day whilst the police continue  investigation work.
